# Register wallet to event example

This example shows how to get event information with otp and register wallet address to event

To start this, install the modules and try out with own ACCESS TOKEN key.

## How to use

Set your ACCESS TOKEN key at `src/main.ts` from Mint Console.

```shell
% npm i
% npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

As for the wallet id / otp:
1. you need to create a wallet list first through mint console
2. after that you can click generate one time url and you'll get the url
3. look for the otp parameter, that is the otp / wallet id
